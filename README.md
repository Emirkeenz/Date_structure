This is a educational project about structers written on C++

Main functions used in the project:
isValidDate(): This function should validate whether a date is valid or not. Ensure that the date is within reasonable ranges for day, month, and year. 
newDate(int d, int m, int y): This function should update the values of variable in Date structure.
getDayOfWeek(): This function should calculate and return the day of the week for a date. You may choose any suitable algorithm for this calculation. 
calculateDifference(const Date& date): This function should calculate the difference in days between two dates and return the result. 
printDate(): This function should print the date in a readable format, such as "January 1, 2023".
operator<(const Date& date): This comparison operator is used to compare two dates according to year, month and day.

You need to specify the date in this format, as written in the code at the beginning of the main function, so that the code works correctly.
